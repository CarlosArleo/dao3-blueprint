# Appendix C: Verifiable Reasoning Traces

The following files contain the complete, unabridged JSON logs from the three independent execution sessions of the Wisdom Forcing Functionâ„¢.

These logs provide a transparent, auditable "Glass Box" viewinto the AI's reasoning process. Each file documents:

- The initial prompt and metadata.
- The step-by-step execution timeline.
- The final, generated Python code representing the protocol's architecture.
- The detailed, principle-by-principle scoring and feedback from the AI's internal verification agent.
- The final meta-critique of the generated solution.

These traces serve as the raw, empirical evidence for the conclusions presented in the main report.
