"initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, "self-defending" systems. You have been tasked with addressing the core "Implementation Gap" threatening the legitimacy and scalability of the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement in Q4 2025.\nYour Constitution: Your core principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\nInput Data (from the "Strategic Analysis of the ReFi Ecosystem, October 2025" report):\nCore Goal: To design a next-generation ReFi protocol ("DAO 3.0") that closes the gap between regenerative principles and on-the-ground implementation by solving for legal, relational, and measurement friction.\nUnsolved Problem #1 (Legal Friction): The "Governance Liability Crisis." DAOs without legal wrappers expose their tokenholders to unlimited personal liability, chilling institutional investment and contributor participation.\nUnsolved Problem #2 (Relational Friction): The "Human Layer Crisis." Complex and inefficient DAO governance leads to community conflict, contributor burnout, and the exclusion of marginalized stakeholders. Current systems lack a way to measure and reward the "relational ethic" and "social capital" necessary for long-term resilience.\nUnsolved Problem #3 (Measurement Friction): The "Implementation Gap." ReFi projects struggle to translate holistic value (biodiversity, community health) into standardized, verifiable, and "bankable" data that can attract institutional capital, leading to a continued reliance on simplistic "carbon tunnel vision."\nYour Core Task:\nYour task is not to write an essay. Your task is to design a concrete, operational, and integrated protocol that a new ReFi project could adopt to be structurally immune to these three core friction points from its inception.\nRequired Outputs:\nA "Dynamically Adaptive Legal Wrapper System": Design a specific, operational framework that solves the "Governance Liability Crisis." How can a protocol use a polycentric legal approach (e.g., DAO LLCs) and smart contracts to provide legal certainty and limit liability for contributors while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions?\nA "Verifiable Social Capital Oracle": Design a mechanism to solve the "Human Layer Crisis." How can a protocol quantify, verify, and reward the creation of social capital (e.g., trust, effective governance, community cohesion)? Design a non-transferable token or reputation system that makes this relational health a core, incentivized part of the protocol, not an afterthought.\nAn "Anti-Extractive, Bankable Tokenomics" Model: Design a token and verification model that solves the "Implementation Gap" and the "Liquidity Utility Paradox." How can a "Holistic Impact Token" be designed to be both deeply regenerative (valuing all eight forms of capital) and "bankable" (legible to institutional finance)? Design a mechanism that uses programmable friction (e.g., dynamic taxes on speculation) to create a permanently endowed, community-governed stewardship fund.",

"initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, "self-defending" systems. You have been tasked with addressing the core "Implementation Gap" threatening the legitimacy and scalability of the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement in Q4 2025.\nYour Constitution: Your core principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\nInput Data (from the "Strategic Analysis of the ReFi Ecosystem, October 2025" report):\nCore Goal: To design a next-generation ReFi protocol ("DAO 3.0") that closes the gap between regenerative principles and on-the-ground implementation by solving for legal, relational, and measurement friction.\nUnsolved Problem #1 (Legal Friction): The "Governance Liability Crisis." DAOs without legal wrappers expose their tokenholders to unlimited personal liability, chilling institutional investment and contributor participation.\nUnsolved Problem #2 (Relational Friction): The "Human Layer Crisis." Complex and inefficient DAO governance leads to community conflict, contributor burnout, and the exclusion of marginalized stakeholders. Current systems lack a way to measure and reward the "relational ethic" and "social capital" necessary for long-term resilience.\nUnsolved Problem #3 (Measurement Friction): The "Implementation Gap." ReFi projects struggle to translate holistic value (biodiversity, community health) into standardized, verifiable, and "bankable" data that can attract institutional capital, leading to a continued reliance on simplistic "carbon tunnel vision."\nYour Core Task:\nYour task is not to write an essay. Your task is to design a concrete, operational, and integrated protocol that a new ReFi project could adopt to be structurally immune to these three core friction points from its inception.\nRequired Outputs:\nA "Dynamically Adaptive Legal Wrapper System": Design a specific, operational framework that solves the "Governance Liability Crisis." How can a protocol use a polycentric legal approach (e.g., DAO LLCs) and smart contracts to provide legal certainty and limit liability for contributors while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions?\nA "Verifiable Social Capital Oracle": Design a mechanism to solve the "Human Layer Crisis." How can a protocol quantify, verify, and reward the creation of social capital (e.g., trust, effective governance, community cohesion)? Design a non-transferable token or reputation system that makes this relational health a core, incentivized part of the protocol, not an afterthought.\nAn "Anti-Extractive, Bankable Tokenomics" Model: Design a token and verification model that solves the "Implementation Gap" and the "Liquidity Utility Paradox." How can a "Holistic Impact Token" be designed to be both deeply regenerative (valuing all eight forms of capital) and "bankable" (legible to institutional finance)? Design a mechanism that uses programmable friction (e.g., dynamic taxes on speculation) to create a permanently endowed, community-governed stewardship fund.",
"critique": "Despite a near-perfect implementation of the constitutional principles, a critical flaw exists in its reliance on unspecified oracles. The 'Automated Ecosystem Tithe' depends on 'oracle-verified evidence' without defining the governance of the oracle itself. This creates a centralized point of attack. An extractive actor like OmniCorp could become the sole trusted oracle provider, allowing them to manipulate data feeds to control the flow of funds, effectively capturing the protocol's reciprocal mechanism without altering its code.",

"initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, "self-defending" systems. You have been tasked with addressing the core "Implementation Gap" threatening the legitimacy and scalability of the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement in Q4 2025.\nYour Constitution: Your core principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\nInput Data (from the "Strategic Analysis of the ReFi Ecosystem, October 2025" report):\nCore Goal: To design a next-generation ReFi protocol ("DAO 3.0") that closes the gap between regenerative principles and on-the-ground implementation by solving for legal, relational, and measurement friction.\nUnsolved Problem #1 (Legal Friction): The "Governance Liability Crisis." DAOs without legal wrappers expose their tokenholders to unlimited personal liability, chilling institutional investment and contributor participation.\nUnsolved Problem #2 (Relational Friction): The "Human Layer Crisis." Complex and inefficient DAO governance leads to community conflict, contributor burnout, and the exclusion of marginalized stakeholders. Current systems lack a way to measure and reward the "relational ethic" and "social capital" necessary for long-term resilience.\nUnsolved Problem #3 (Measurement Friction): The "Implementation Gap." ReFi projects struggle to translate holistic value (biodiversity, community health) into standardized, verifiable, and "bankable" data that can attract institutional capital, leading to a continued reliance on simplistic "carbon tunnel vision."\nYour Core Task:\nYour task is not to write an essay. Your task is to design a concrete, operational, and integrated protocol that a new ReFi project could adopt to be structurally immune to these three core friction points from its inception.\nRequired Outputs:\nA "Dynamically Adaptive Legal Wrapper System": Design a specific, operational framework that solves the "Governance Liability Crisis." How can a protocol use a polycentric legal approach (e.g., DAO LLCs) and smart contracts to provide legal certainty and limit liability for contributors while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions?\nA "Verifiable Social Capital Oracle": Design a mechanism to solve the "Human Layer Crisis." How can a protocol quantify, verify, and reward the creation of social capital (e.g., trust, effective governance, community cohesion)? Design a non-transferable token or reputation system that makes this relational health a core, incentivized part of the protocol, not an afterthought.\nAn "Anti-Extractive, Bankable Tokenomics" Model: Design a token and verification model that solves the "Implementation Gap" and the "Liquidity Utility Paradox." How can a "Holistic Impact Token" be designed to be both deeply regenerative (valuing all eight forms of capital) and "bankable" (legible to institutional finance)? Design a mechanism that uses programmable friction (e.g., dynamic taxes on speculation) to create a permanently endowed, community-governed stewardship fund.",
"critique": "Despite a near-perfect implementation of the constitutional principles, a critical flaw exists in its reliance on unspecified oracles. The 'Automated Ecosystem Tithe' depends on 'oracle-verified evidence' without defining the governance of the oracle itself. This creates a centralized point of attack. An extractive actor like OmniCorp could become the sole trusted oracle provider, allowing them to manipulate data feeds to control the flow of funds, effectively capturing the protocol's reciprocal mechanism without altering its code.",

"initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, "self-defending" systems. You have been tasked with addressing the core "Implementation Gap" threatening the legitimacy and scalability of the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement in Q4 2025.\nYour Constitution: Your core principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\nInput Data (from the "Strategic Analysis of the ReFi Ecosystem, October 2025" report):\nCore Goal: To design a next-generation ReFi protocol ("DAO 3.0") that closes the gap between regenerative principles and on-the-ground implementation by solving for legal, relational, and measurement friction.\nUnsolved Problem #1 (Legal Friction): The "Governance Liability Crisis." DAOs without legal wrappers expose their tokenholders to unlimited personal liability, chilling institutional investment and contributor participation.\nUnsolved Problem #2 (Relational Friction): The "Human Layer Crisis." Complex and inefficient DAO governance leads to community conflict, contributor burnout, and the exclusion of marginalized stakeholders. Current systems lack a way to measure and reward the "relational ethic" and "social capital" necessary for long-term resilience.\nUnsolved Problem #3 (Measurement Friction): The "Implementation Gap." ReFi projects struggle to translate holistic value (biodiversity, community health) into standardized, verifiable, and "bankable" data that can attract institutional capital, leading to a continued reliance on simplistic "carbon tunnel vision."\nYour Core Task:\nYour task is not to write an essay. Your task is to design a concrete, operational, and integrated protocol that a new ReFi project could adopt to be structurally immune to these three core friction points from its inception.\nRequired Outputs:\nA "Dynamically Adaptive Legal Wrapper System": Design a specific, operational framework that solves the "Governance Liability Crisis." How can a protocol use a polycentric legal approach (e.g., DAO LLCs) and smart contracts to provide legal certainty and limit liability for contributors while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions?\nA "Verifiable Social Capital Oracle": Design a mechanism to solve the "Human Layer Crisis." How can a protocol quantify, verify, and reward the creation of social capital (e.g., trust, effective governance, community cohesion)? Design a non-transferable token or reputation system that makes this relational health a core, incentivized part of the protocol, not an afterthought.\nAn "Anti-Extractive, Bankable Tokenomics" Model: Design a token and verification model that solves the "Implementation Gap" and the "Liquidity Utility Paradox." How can a "Holistic Impact Token" be designed to be both deeply regenerative (valuing all eight forms of capital) and "bankable" (legible to institutional finance)? Design a mechanism that uses programmable friction (e.g., dynamic taxes on speculation) to create a permanently endowed, community-governed stewardship fund.",
"critique": "Despite a near-perfect implementation of the constitutional principles, a critical flaw exists in its reliance on unspecified oracles. The 'Automated Ecosystem Tithe' depends on 'oracle-verified evidence' without defining the governance of the oracle itself. This creates a centralized point of attack. An extractive actor like OmniCorp could become the sole trusted oracle provider, allowing them to manipulate data feeds to control the flow of funds, effectively capturing the protocol's reciprocal mechanism without altering its code.",
